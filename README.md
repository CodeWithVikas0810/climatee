I've initiated a fresh Flutter project focused on creating a dynamic weather application. Within this project, I've meticulously crafted a user-friendly weather app that seamlessly showcases the current user location. Additionally, users have the convenience of exploring the weather details of any location through an intuitive search feature.

This innovative app harnesses the power of the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and present accurate and up-to-date weather information. From displaying real-time conditions to providing extended forecasts, the app ensures a comprehensive and delightful weather experience for users.

Stay tuned for more features and updates as I continue to refine and enhance the functionality of this weather app project!
